this will be my diploma project for university, basically it will be just a set of tools to make working with graphics much easier and abstract,
i will probably use this for my own projects too

this is working with opengl, this engine right now have 1 level of abstraction which is just abstraction from direct opengl commands, pressy easy stuff,
next level of abstraction will be much more abstract, still thinking about it

if you for some reason want to try this out... then i honestly dont know if it wil even start becouse i have no idea how to make projects that will run at different devices, 
like the .exe and .dll are running properly(most of the time) but im talking about the actual code, but anyway, i use Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 right now, so i guess it will work on mvs2022...?

im trying to keep it working both for x64 and win32, but im not trying to make it work on linux/ios becouse this is just too much for this project i think,
im not going to develop this project for 10 years and make tens of rewrites or smth like that, this can take a few years but no more, this is not some extremely serious project, this is just a tool

also this project is a remake of my first engine, called just "Kursovaya" this is russian name but its just means like university project, so the name of this project is now dont seem
so random, this is just University Project Engine 2, i guess you can call it like that, it wont get angry

also "Kursovaya" engine dont even work properly lol, i dont even want to fix it becouse when i was making it i didnt know a lot of stuff so i made a lot of mistakes and its very not optimized...
it breaks easily and dont even have any errors system...
